# RESTful-Python-Web-Services
REST (short for REpresentational State Transfer) is the architectural style that is driving modern web development and mobile app development. In fact, developing and interacting with RESTful web services is a required skill in any modern software development job. Sometimes, you have to interact with an existing API and in other cases, you have to design a RESTful API from scratch and make it work with JSON (short for JavaScript Object Notation)
